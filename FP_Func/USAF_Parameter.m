%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% All main.m, AtlerMin.m, GDUpdate_Multiplication_rank1.m, USAF_Parameter.m, 
% hela_Parameter.m files are modified and extended to:
%
% 1- allowing a FULL reconstruction of the input images for 
% any dimesnions (i.e. not only square crops of them!).
% 2- saving images (and figures) for multiple variables.
% 3- saving dirac peaks positions.
% 4- adding more descriptive comments (in addition to those added by Ivo Ihrke).
% 4- investigating the huge error of the Algorithm to be due to pixels w/ 
% very large (intensity) values in the input stacks (and not due to
% the Algorithm itself!).
